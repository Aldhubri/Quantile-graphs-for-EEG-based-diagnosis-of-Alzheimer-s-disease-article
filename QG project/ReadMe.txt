
Here are some notes for this project:

 - platform: The Jupyter Notebook is based on python.
 
 - Data from channel F7 were selected in the simulations as performed in the purposed paper.
 
 - The CC(k), Î”(k), BC(k), Mo(k), and LEE(k), were computed for two sample segments each, for groups A, and D.
 
 - The output data for most matrices and measures are attached in two text files (quantile_graph_output Group A.js, and quantile_graph_output Group D.js).
   Please use any text editor to open these files such as Notepad++:
   (Link: https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/releases/download/v8.4.4/npp.8.4.4.Installer.x64.exe))
   
 - We visualized 25 network graphs and created the two Html files(Ploting_Outpots_For_GroupA, and Ploting_Outpots_For_GroupD ) to display output plotting.
 - We plotted the Scalp activities based on shortest path length and laplacian_matrix.
