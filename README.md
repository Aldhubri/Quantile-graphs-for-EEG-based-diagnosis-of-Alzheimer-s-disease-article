This paper maps the time series of length T=1024 into complex network g={ N,A}âˆˆG. Where N is a set of vertices or nodes in g that are connected by a set of weighted arcs A. Firstly, the time series X(t) is split into 20 Quantiles (represent the colored shading.), in which, each quantile q_i is assigned to the corresponding node n_i.  Two nodes n_i and n_j in g are connected by the weighted arc (n_i,n_j,w_ij).  This representation will give a weighted adjacency matrix W. when W is normalized with Markov transition the resulting time series is as continuously smooth as possible. The resulted matrix W feds as input to five matrices that extract key features of time series (e.g., clustering coefficient, mean jump length, betweenness centrality, modularity, and Laplacian Estrada index matrices). The five output matrices fid into the SVM classifier. The SVM classifies two states: healthy elderly subjects and patients with AD.
